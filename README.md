# Pomodoro Timer
This is the [paired programming assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project) to make a pomodoro timer. However, finding a partner to work together remotely is quite difficult, so I made the pomodoro timer on my own.
The goal of this timer was to practice basic JavaScript. To view a live demo, visit:
